  *create page for account
    -remember? we have just set up our mutation and route for checking auth 
    -isEditLocked is now responding to our submit 
    -we have onsuccess and onerror handling 
    -the main concerns now are that the component is too big and messy 
    -add loading state to Unlock btn
    -and we need to UI change for editable vs non editable states    
      -passwordUnlock Input is unmounted and Text should appear in its place
      -big text that says so 
      -Input border changes
      -all account info starts out as inputs prop={readOnly} elements
      -once unlocked - all inputs becomes writeable
    -  add edit password func --- 2 inputs one primary and one confirm
    - add add category input -- run match to see if category already exists, toLowercase to even it out
    -add submit actions to both username/password & add Category
    -separate sections (and submits) for regular account info and add new category

  *add funct to logout button
  *look through components and reorganize them
  *add edit and delete func to ind. blog post page
  *fix create post Mutation 
      -add error handling 
        -if error == server_error - display something
        - if error == invalid-token -redirect

  *add pagination for posts
  *add filter option to search posts  
  
  * UseAuth() custom hook is not firing on redirect after login
    -it only fires on component mount -- will require another method

  *look at protected-routes project to understand the different methods of auth routing
